Jenkins LSST Stack Demo
=======================

Synopsis
---

This is a demonstration of deploying a complete
[`jenkins`](https://jenkins-ci.org/) master + build slaves environment to
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) EC2 which is pre-configured to build the LSST
Stack.  The principle goal is to demonstrate a possible migration path away
from LSST DM's existing CI infrastructure.  The key feature improvements over
the existing [`buildbot`](http://buildbot.net/) driven system are:

* concurrently running a build on multiple operating systems
* multiple independent builds of the same job occurring in parallel

A secondary objective is provide an example of deploying a moderately complex
application onto a modern cloud infrastructure.

High level architecture
---

![AWS VPC diagram](./docs/aws_vpc.png)

The instances running the jenkins master and slave processes are deployed into
an AWS "Virtual Private Cloud" or [VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/).  Using a
non-default VPC (historically, AWS had separate classic and VPC environments;
all newly created AWS accounts have a default VPC in each region that more or
less emulates the "classic" behavior) allows for direct control over the
RFC1918 private address space.  A benefit of this is that the master instance
can have a fixed IP address which the slaves can locate by convention instead
of requiring either the address to be injected or use of a service discovery
mechanism.

Tooling
---

### `packer`

The Centos project supplies "official" `x86_64 HVM` Amazon Machine Images
(AMIs) for both Centos 6 and 7 in all EC2 regions.  However, the images are
slightly out of date, 6.5 vs. 6.6 and 7.0 vs. 7.1, and the Centos 6 image does
not include [`cloud-init`](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) or is
it compatible with vagrant.  The popular
[`chef/bento`](https://github.com/chef/bento) [`packer`](https://packer.io/)
templates were modified to install/configure `cloud-init` for Centos 6, update
the images to the current minor releases, and make both images more friendly
for usage with vagrant.

### `terraform`

As with any network environment, a VPC requires a fair amount of configuration.
Instead of requiring manual interaction via the AWS console,
[`terraform`](https://www.terraform.io/) is used to configure fully configure
the VPC.  Note that terraform has the capability to spawn EC2 instances and
could completely replace vagrant at the expense of loosing a convenient
development/debugging mechanism.

The terraform configuration files are under the ['terraform'](./terraform)
directory.

### `vagrant`

EC2 instances are created/destroyed via
[`vagrant`](https://www.vagrantup.com/).  Vagrant is also used to pass "User
Data" to cloud-init and to run puppet on each node in "masterless" mode.

Vagrant is configured via the ['Vagrantfile'](./Vagrantfile).

### `cloud-init`

There are a number of low-level configurations needed in a cloud environment.
Including:

  * ssh key injection / sudo management
  * dynamic resizing of the instance's block storage
  * hostname/host file management

[`cloud-init`](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is relied upon to
provide those functions in demo.

### `puppet`

The bulk of the "heavy lifting" (configuring the instances) in this demo is
done by a composition of [`puppet`](https://puppetlabs.com/) modules.   This is
implemented via a bundled "site" module that implements the [Roles and
Profiles](http://www.craigdunn.org/2012/05/239/) pattern.

  * The puppet modules in use are listed in the [Puppetfile](./Puppetfile).
  * The site module is under the [`jenkins_demo`](./jenkins_demo) directory.

Notable omissions
---

### jenkins security

_jenkins does not have any access control enabled.  This means that *anyone*
can change anything, include the jenkins configuration, essentially allowing
arbitrary code to be executed under the jenkins role account._

There is on going development to improve the
[`rtyle/jenkins`](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/rtyler/jenkins) puppet module so
that is can handle the complete set of security configuration needed for a
production deployment without requiring manual configuration by the
administrator.

### DNS

The demo attaches an elastic IP address (public IP) but does not manage DNS
configuration for this address.  There are a number of ways of automatically
handling this including via the terraform aws provider.

### jenkins plugins

There are a number of plugins that are not configured via this demo as it would
require exposing secrets. This includes github oauth integration, hipchat
notifications, and email notifications.

### metric collection

The demo enables cloud watch metric collection about the instances which is
completely external to jenkins and not visible external to the AWS account.  A
full production deployment would likely involved additional jenkins plugins for
metric collection and instance level metrics collected external to jenkins
which are then made available to end users via a web interface.

### backups

There are absolutely no provisions taken for backing up either jenkins data or
snapshotting the instances.

Prerequisites
